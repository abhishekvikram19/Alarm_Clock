# Alarm_Clock
Creating an alarm clock. Using ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks and HTML & CSS.
In this Project
I have added comments above each section of the code to provide a better understanding of the purpose and functionality of each part.

HTML:

The HTML code defines the structure of the alarm clock interface.
It includes a heading, a clock display, a time selection area, and buttons for setting and stopping the alarm.
CSS:

The CSS code defines the styles and layout of the alarm clock interface.
It includes styles for the clock display, time selection area, buttons, and number options.
The number options have a basic layout, width, height, text alignment, and border styling.
JavaScript:

The JavaScript code adds functionality to the alarm clock.
It retrieves elements from the HTML document using getElementById.
The updateClock function is responsible for updating the clock display with the current time every second.
The setAlarmButton and stopAlarmButton have click event listeners to handle setting and stopping the alarm.
The playAlarm function plays an audio file when the alarm is activated and scrolls the page to the bottom.
The stopAlarm function stops the audio playback when the alarm is stopped.

Overall, this project demonstrates the basic implementation of an alarm clock interface, allowing users to set an alarm time and receive an audio notification when the time is reached.
